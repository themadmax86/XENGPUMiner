Please note that this Quick Start assumes you are on a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu) and have some knowledge of Linux command line, and it is only intended to serve as a basic guide to get the software running quickly. For more detailed information on building and configuring the miner, refer to the relevant sections of this document.

## Building

### Preliminary Setup for Beginners

If you are unfamiliar with the building process or are encountering difficulties, you can run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies. If you are familiar with this process, feel free to adapt according to your preferences.

```sh
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install git cmake make sudo -y
```
Remember, these commands are for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. Please adapt them according to your operating system if needed.

Note: The sudo command is generally installed by default on most Linux distributions, but it is included in the command just in case it is not present.

### Building from Source

To build from the source, follow the steps below. Please make sure you have `git`, `cmake`, and `make` installed on your system. If not, you can install them using your system's package manager.

Now, proceed with the following steps to clone the repository and build the project:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/shanhaicoder/XENGPUMiner.git 
cd XENGPUMiner
chmod +x build.sh
```

### OpenCL Installation
To enable OpenCL support, you need to install the OpenCL development package. On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```
Please adapt the command according to your operating system if it's not a Debian-based system.

### CUDA Installation
For CUDA support, you need to have both the NVIDIA driver and the CUDA Toolkit installed. You can refer to the official [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) to download and install the CUDA Toolkit suitable for your system.

Before installing the CUDA Toolkit, run the `nvidia-smi` command to check the existing driver installation and verify the compatibility of your driver version with the CUDA Toolkit version you plan to install. If you need to update your NVIDIA driver, please refer to the official [NVIDIA Driver Download](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) page.

Here's a general guideline for installing CUDA:

1. Check your NVIDIA driver installation and version with nvidia-smi.
2. Refer to the official CUDA Toolkit Archive and download a compatible version.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the download page to install the CUDA Toolkit.

### Execute build.sh
Before running the build script, you can specify the CUDA architecture you are targeting by using the -cuda_arch flag followed by your CUDA architecture version. For example, if you are targeting CUDA architecture 6.1, you would run:

``` bash
./build.sh -cuda_arch sm_61
```

When building the project, it is crucial to specify the correct `cuda_arch` value to optimize the performance of your application. This value should correspond to the Compute Capability of your Nvidia GPU.

You can refer to [NVIDIA CUDA GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute) to find the correct Compute Capability value for your GPU model. Or this is beter: [matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/), make sure you have a higher version CUDA toolkit installed. Once you have identified the right value, specify it with the `-cuda_arch` flag when running the build script, as shown below:

```sh
./build.sh -cuda_arch sm_86  # Example: For a GPU with Compute Capability 8.6
```
If you omit the `-cuda_arch` flag, the build script will default to using `sm_75`. While the script may still run without specifying `cuda_arch`, defining it correctly ensures that you are utilizing your GPU to its full potential.

## Usage

It is crucial to understand that `miner.py` and `xengpuminer` must operate concurrently within the same directory. `xengpuminer` executes the local, offline mining processes through files, while `miner.py` is responsible for outputting `difficulty.txt` and continuously monitoring and verifying the blocks output to the `gpu_found_blocks_tmp` directory before uploading them. Their interdependence means they need to be run in tandem in the same directory for the entire mining operation to function correctly.

### Specific Responsibilities of Each Component:

1. **xengpuminer:**
   - Performs offline, local mining.
   - Processes data through files.
   - Does not require network connectivity.

2. **miner.py:**
   - Outputs the `difficulty.txt` file.
   - Continuously scans, verifies, and uploads the blocks found in the `gpu_found_blocks_tmp` directory.
   - Requires network connectivity to upload verified blocks.

### Running the Components

Before running the Python miner, if you have not run the CPU version before, make sure to install the necessary Python packages by running the following command:
```sh
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that both `miner.py` and `xengpuminer` are launched within the same directory. Their cooperative operation is pivotal for seamless mining and uploading of blocks.

```sh
# Running miner.py
$ python miner.py --gpu=true

# Running xengpuminer in a separate session or terminal, but in the same directory
$ ./xengpuminer
```

### Additional Configuration Options
You can also specify whether to enable GPU mode by adding the --gpu parameter when running the Python miner:

```sh
$ python miner.py --gpu=true  # To enable GPU mode (default)
$ python miner.py --gpu=false  # To disable GPU mode and run in CPU mode
```
Note: The -b parameter represents the number of hashes to process in a single batch. While the maximum value for this parameter is dependent on the available GPU memory, a moderate value is recommended. As long as the total number of hashes is sufficient, a moderate batch size should suffice.

Typically, about difficulty * [-b para] * 1024 Bytes of GPU memory is needed.

If you are running the miner with OpenCL, add the -m opencl parameter:

```sh
$ ./xengpuminer -m opencl
```
The -b parameter is not mandatory. If omitted, the system will automatically adjust the batch size for optimum resource utilization.
Note: If opencl is used, two-thirds of the total gpu memory will be used for computing

## Listing Available Devices

To view a list of all available devices that XENGPUMiner can utilize, you can use the `-l` argument, combined with either `-m opencl` or `-m cuda` to specify the type of devices you want to list:

```bash
./xengpuminer -l -m opencl
```
or
```bash
./xengpuminer -l -m cuda
```

This command will display a list of all the GPUs available on your system, along with their indices, which you can use with the `-d <GPU_INDEX>` argument to select a specific GPU for mining.


### Running with Specific GPU

XENGPUMiner supports multiple GPUs, and you can specify which GPU to use by providing the `-d` argument followed by the index of the GPU.

```bash
./xengpuminer -d <GPU_INDEX>
```
Where <GPU_INDEX> is the index of the GPU you want to use. For example, to use the first GPU, you can run:
```bash
./xengpuminer -d 0
```
To use the second GPU, you can run:
```bash
./xengpuminer -d 1
```
Running with Multiple GPUs
To run XENGPUMiner with multiple GPUs, you can start separate instances of the program, each specifying a different GPU index with the `-d` argument. Ensure each instance is run in a separate session or terminal window.

#### Quick Tips

To reattach to a screen session, use `screen -r miner`.
Check your system documentation for more advanced usage of `nohup` and `screen`.

To run the miner in the background, you can use nohup or screen (depending on your system and preferences):
```sh
nohup ./xengpuminer &
```
Or, with screen **recommanded**:
```sh
screen -S miner
./xengpuminer
# Press 'Ctrl-A' followed by 'D' to detach the screen session.
```
### Configuration Reminder
Before starting the miner, don't forget to configure your account address in the `config.conf` file. The default account address is set to `0x24691e54afafe2416a8252097c9ca67557271475`. Please replace it with your own account address to receive mining rewards.

Here’s how the `config.conf` file will look:

```ini
account = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```
Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` with your actual account address.
